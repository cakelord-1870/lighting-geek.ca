    <td colspan="2"><p>&lt;p&gt;The DragonX Flat Panel Troffers uses the most energy-efficient LEDs to provide the most cost-saving lighting solutions. By using edge-lit technology, the light comes from the edges and produces a much more uniform and natural display. Despite new features, it retains the many qualities of a traditional troffer and can easily be installed into any 2x2 ceiling space. Combined with its modern design, this fixture brings ambient lighting to any indoor environment. &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;At 100 lumens / watt, this fixture has one of the highest efficacies in the industry. This 5000K (cool white) panel troffer comes in two different sizes: 2’x2’. &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; SUPER BRIGHT LED LIGHT: The DragonX panel troffer produces 6000 lumens and has a 80+ CRI, making it one of the brightest LED light fixtures in the market. &lt;/li&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;li&gt; EVEN LIGHT DISTRIBUTION &amp; NO GLARES: Since the product is edge-lit, the panel has no glare spot. The seamless display of light emulates uniform and natural lighting is easy to look at. &lt;/li&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;li&gt;LONG LIFE AND ENERGY SAVING: The LED lights are cETLus rated, which ensure great reliability. Unlike traditional troffers, there will be no need to replace the tubes. The 36W panel is comparable to traditional 120W light in terms of output. &lt;/li&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;li&gt;EASY INSTALLATION: The setup is very easy as the panel can be lay flat into any designated 2x2 spaces. Hinges of four are available for every 2x2 feet to give users the option to hoist. &lt;/li&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;li&gt;IDEAL FOR INDOORS: Most commercial buildings with the designated 2x2 spaces can make use of this modern light. &lt;/li&gt;</p></td>
